## About


<strong> About: </strong> I'm an Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Tel Aviv University, working in the field of experimental
fluid mechanics and heat transfer, focusing on Lagrangian aspects of turbulent flows with additives and
minimally intrusive experimental methods. I strongly support open science and open software.

<strong> Short bio: </strong> originally from Odessa, Urkaine, I started my studies at the Odessa Polytechnic University. In 1991 I moved to Israel and continued towards an engineering degree at the Technion, Haifa. After my masters thesis in  dynamics and control at the Faculty of Agricultural Engineering, I changed the subject for my Ph.D. in experimental fluid mechanics (at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering) and this topic became my field of research. I like a lot to learn about new things, to develop new experimental methods and mostly to spend time in the lab. See below a brief overview of my career:
