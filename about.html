## About


Originally from Odessa, Urkaine, I started with Mechanical Engineering at the Odessa Polytechnic University. In 1991 I moved
to Israel and studied at the Technion, Haifa. After the M.Sc. in dynamics and control at the Agricultural Engineering, I did my Ph.D. in
experimental fluid mechanics (Mechanical Engineering) and that became my field of research. I like a lot to study
new things, develop new experimental methods and spend time in the lab. See below a brief overview of my career.
